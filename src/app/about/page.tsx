            Hi, I’m Michal, a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong
            background in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,
            and modern web technologies. My programming journey began in
            elementary school when my father gave me a book titled
            <i>&quot;Tvorba WWW stránek pro úplné začátečníky&quot;</i>{" "}
            (Creating Websites for Complete Beginners). It not only introduced
            me to the basics of web development but also deepened my fascination
            with computers and the endless possibilities of programming.
            Combined with my love for video games, this early experience
            solidified my dream of becoming a programmer.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 max-w-2xl">
            I built a strong foundation in programming and technology at the
            Secondary Technical School Purkyňova, where I specialized in
            Graphics and Web Design during my later years. After graduating, I
            pursued Informatics at <strong>Masaryk University</strong>,
            completing coursework in Python, Haskell, and C programming. During
            this time, I gained hands-on experience through an internship at{" "}
            <strong>IBM</strong>, where I contributed to building components for
            internal dashboards and further solidified my programming
            fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 max-w-2xl">
            My professional career began with part-time React development while
            still in university. Eventually, I transitioned to full-time
            frontend development, collaborating on diverse projects like online
            map editing tools, Progressive Web Apps, and insurance web forms.
            Along the way, I’ve had the opportunity to work with various
            companies, including MapTiler, Direct Pojišťovna, and InQool, where
            I focused on delivering practical solutions and improving user
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 max-w-2xl">
            Beyond coding, I’m a dedicated home barista, a former national-level
            rower who transitioned to amateur bodybuilding and later to
            powerlifting, and a travel enthusiast. These passions shape my
            attention to detail, perseverance, and creativity – qualities I
            bring to both my personal and professional life.
